   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app in the browser.

5. Customize the template by navigating to the `/src/components` directory. Modify texts, pictures, and other information as needed.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes. ESLint and Prettier will automatically format your code on save.
